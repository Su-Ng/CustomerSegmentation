# CustomerSegmentation

Customer Segmentation is an interesting data science application. I will be using it to analyse the age, income, gender of the people shopping in the mall.

This idea to do this is to gain insights into what are the demographics of the people shopping in the mall. I want to find out who are the highest spenders in the mall. With this knowledge and insight, we can target the right consumers who are most likely to spend.

Using machine learning algorithm, k nearest neighbour kNN, I aim to find clusters showing particular income group spending more, as well as a particular age group spending more. This can help the mall tenants understand how to increase their sales by selling more products catered to this income group and age group
