# CustomerSegmentation

Customer Segmentation is an interesting data science application. I will be using it to analyse the age, income, gender of the people shopping in the dataase

This idea to do this is to gain as insight into what are the demographics of the people shopping in the mall. With the idea who are the highest spenders in the mall, we can target the right consumers who are most likely to spend.
